# coptic-nlp
Coptic NLP pipeline page and utilities

Production version at:
https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/coptic-nlp/

This code is openly available but is not meant to work out-of-the-box. Note that if you are trying to 
clone the production server, you will need to configure paths.py to point to working versions 
of the Coptic NLP scripts, TreeTagger and MaltParser.
